# Contributing

## Scope

This repository is primarily a **theme pack**. By default, contributions should focus on:

- repo structure / filenames
- documentation (README)
- screenshots / previews
- install helpers
- CI checks (JSON validity)

## Theme payload stability

Unless an issue explicitly requests it, avoid changing the `style` objects (colors/tokens).  
If you propose a theme payload change, include:

- before/after screenshots
- a short rationale (readability/contrast/ergonomics)
- confirmation that no unintended token regressions occur

## Pull requests

- Keep PRs small and focused.
- Ensure CI passes (JSON validity + README image links).
